We accomplished all tasks for this milestone. We spent less time than we estimated on this milestone. We encountered problems with the multiprocessing due to passing the wrong arguments to the given functions. We also implemented some extra-credit features. We implented a bg-command, that changes the background color to green and the text color to blue. We implemented help, that lists all the available commands and their respective descriptions.
 
1. Users should be able to run multiple processes at once. (3 hours)
2. When users start a program, the calling program (the shell) should still run, so the user should be able to run commands in the shell while running other programs. (1.5 hours)
3. Users should be able to kill processes. (1 hour)
4. Users should see file sizes when using the dir-command. (already done)
5. Users should be able to use the help-command. This command will list all the available commands. (1 hour)
 
Total time estimated: 6.5 hours
