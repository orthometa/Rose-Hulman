Fill in this README with the information requested in the project specs.

instructions for building your operating system,
instructions for testing and using the operating system,
additional features that you implemented. 

To build our operating system, navigate to the project's root directory and type "chmod +x compileOS.sh" to make sure that your computer recognizes the shell file to build the project.
Then, type "./compileOS.sh" to run the script.  Then, type "bochs -f opsys.bxrc" to run the operating system.


At the current moment, the operating system does not respond to any user input and thus cannot be tested.

The Operating System now prints "Hello World!" when booted up.
