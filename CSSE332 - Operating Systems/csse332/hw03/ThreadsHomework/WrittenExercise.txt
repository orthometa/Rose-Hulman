Section 02
If the number of cores is greater than the number of kernel threads, then some of the cores will always be idle since nothing would be given to those cores. 

If the number of cores is equal to the number of kernel threads, then all the cores can be used simultaneously. However if for some reason a kernel thread stops, a core will be unused.

If the number of cores is less than the number of kernel threads, all of the cores can be used simultaneously, and there are kernel threads standing by if a core is a free.
