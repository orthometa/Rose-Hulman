franklin pierce franklin pierce became president at a time of apparent tranquility the united states by virtue of the compromise of 1850 seemed to have weathered it sectional storm by pursuing the recommendation of southern adviser pierce--a new englander--hoped to prevent still another outbreak of that storm but his policy far from preserving calm hastened the disruption of the union born in hillsborough new hampshire in 1804 pierce attended bowdoin college after graduation he studied law then entered politics at 24 he wa elected to the new hampshire legislature; two year later he became it speaker during the 1830's he went to washington first a a representative then a a senator pierce after serving in the mexican war wa proposed by new hampshire friend for the presidential nomination in 1852 at the democratic convention the delegate agreed easily enough upon a platform pledging undeviating support of the compromise of 1850 and hostility to any effort to agitate the slavery question but they balloted 48 time and eliminated all the well-known candidate before nominating pierce a true dark horse probably because the democrats stood more firmly for the compromise than the whigs and because whig candidate gen winfield scott wa suspect in the south pierce won with a narrow margin of popular vote two month before he took office he and his wife saw their eleven-year-old son killed when their train wa wrecked grief-stricken pierce entered the presidency nervously exhausted in his inaugural he proclaimed an era of peace and prosperity at home and vigor in relation with other nation the united states might have to acquire additional possession for the sake of it own security he pointed out and would not be deterred by any timid foreboding of evil pierce had only to make gesture toward expansion to excite the wrath of northerner who accused him of acting a a cat's-paw of southerners eager to extend slavery into other area therefore he aroused apprehension when he pressured great britain to relinquish it special interest along part of the central american coast and even more when he tried to persuade spain to sell cuba but the most violent renewal of the storm stemmed from the kansas-nebraska act which repealed the missouri compromise and reopened the question of slavery in the west this measure the handiwork of senator stephen a douglas grew in part out of his desire to promote a railroad from chicago to california through nebraska already secretary of war jefferson davis advocate of a southern transcontinental route had persuaded pierce to send james gadsden to mexico to buy land for a southern railroad he purchased the area now comprising southern arizona and part of southern new mexico for $10 000 000 douglas's proposal to organize western territory through which a railroad might run caused extreme trouble douglas provided in his bill that the resident of the new territory could decide the slavery question for themselves the result wa a rush into kansas a southerner and northerner vied for control of the territory shooting broke out and bleeding kansas became a prelude to the civil war by the end of his administration pierce could claim a peaceful condition of thing in kansas but to his disappointment the democrats refused to renominate him turning to the le controversial buchanan pierce returned to new hampshire leaving his successor to face the rising fury of the sectional whirlwind he died in 1869
